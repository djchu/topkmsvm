## Description
The toolbox implements the optimized SDCA algorithm via semismooth Newton method for top-k multiclass SVM described in our following paper:

Dejun Chu, Rui Lu, Jin Li, Xintong Yu, Changshui Zhang and Qing Tao, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2018.

It contains serveral algorithms described in our manuscript and implemented
in C language which must be compiled by the MEX compiler.
So please run make.m first on Matlab if the existing mex file does not work.
It should be used under Linux or Mac system.

Note that there are two demos in the toolbox root.
